      "contents": "\nResearch Interests\nThe Innate Immune Response to Viral Infections\nThe innate immune response is the body’s first defense against pathogens. My lab is interested in understanding how viruses activate and subvert this defensive system. We work in a large collaborative environment studying herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Current areas of investigation include how these viruses activate inflammatory pathways, alter innate immune cell signaling, and interact with novel regulators of these pathways.\nCreated in BioRenderVaccine Response in Immunocompromised Hosts\nVaccines remain our best tool to prevent infection and disease. Unfortunately, people with immunocompromising conditions (bone marrow or organ transplant recipients) often do not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to vaccines. This leaves them vulnerable to infection. My lab works with other investigators to understand the vaccine response in these immunocompromised patients and how we can improve that response to protect them from disease.\nOpen Research Positions\nTransplant/Oncology Infectious Diseases\nMy primary clinical focus is on preventing and treating infections in immunocompromised patients. This includes bone marrow transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer. I see patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital and affiliated clinics. I have a particular interest in novel treatments for viral infections in this population.\nSelected Publications\nKaraba AH, Zhu X, Liang T, Wang KH, Rittenhouse AG, Akinde O, et al. A Third Dose of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Increases Neutralizing Antibodies Against Variants of Concern in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients. medRxiv. 2021; 2021.08.11.21261914. doi:10.1101/2021.08.11.21261914\nRuddy JA, Boyarsky BJ, Bailey JR, Karaba AH, Garonzik-Wang JM, Segev DL, et al. Safety and antibody response to two-dose SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccination in persons with HIV.
