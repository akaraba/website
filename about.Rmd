I am a practicing physician scientist at Johns Hopkins studying the immune response to viruses in the viral hepatitis center and taking care of immunocompromised patients as part of the transplant/oncology infectious disease team. When not in the lab or hospital I am probably brewing beer, birding, cooking, or playing outside with my sons and wife.
