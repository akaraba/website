My lab is interested in understanding how viruses activate\nand subvert this defensive system. We work in a large collaborative\nenvironment studying herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2,\nand influenza. Current areas of investigation include how these viruses\nactivate inflammatory pathways, alter innate immune cell signaling, and\ninteract with novel regulators of these pathways.\nCreated in BioRenderVaccine Response in\nImmunocompromised Hosts\nVaccines remain our best tool to prevent infection and disease.\nUnfortunately, people with immunocompromising conditions (bone marrow or\norgan transplant recipients) often do not respond as well as\nimmunocompetent individuals to vaccines. This leaves them vulnerable to\ninfection. My lab works with other investigators to understand the\nvaccine response in these immunocompromised patients and how we can\nimprove that response to protect them from disease.\nOpen Research\nPositions\nTransplant/Oncology\nInfectious Diseases\nMy primary clinical focus is on preventing and treating infections in\nimmunocompromised patients. This includes bone marrow transplant\nrecipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients undergoing\nchemotherapy treatment for cancer. I see patients at Johns Hopkins\nHospital and affiliated clinics. I have a particular interest in novel\ntreatments for viral infections in this population.\nSelected Publications\nKaraba AH, Zhou W, Li S, Aytenfisu TY, Johnston TS,\nAkinde O, et al. Impact of Seasonal Coronavirus Antibodies on SARS-CoV-2\nVaccine Responses in Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.
