# Research Interests  

### The Innate Immune Response to Viral Infections

The innate immune response is the body’s first defense against pathogens.  My lab is interested in understanding how viruses activate and subvert this defensive system.  We work in a large collaborative environment studying herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza.  Current areas of investigation include how these viruses activate inflammatory pathways, alter innate immune cell signaling, and interact with novel regulators of these pathways.

### Vaccine Response in Immunocompromised Hosts

Vaccines remain our best tool to prevent infection and disease.  Unfortunately, people with immunocompromising conditions (bone marrow or organ transplant recipients) often do not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to vaccines.  This leaves them vulnerable to infection. My lab works with other investigators to understand the vaccine response in these immunocompromised patients and how we can improve that response to protect them from disease.

# Transplant/Oncology Infectious Diseases
  My primary clinical focus is on preventing and treating infections in immunocompromised patients.  This includes bone marrow transplant recipients, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.  I see patients at Johns Hopkins Hospital and affiliated clinics.  I have a particular interest in novel treatments for viral infections in this population.
